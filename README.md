# Simulation-of-a-physical-system-for-an-application-of-reinforcement-learning
The aim of this thesis work was the implementation of a solution to a classic RL problem by using a software for simulation in the robotic field to create the environment with which the RL agent will interact, while for the training was chosen to use a different software that already provides deep RL algorithms (i.e. that exploit neural networks), to be configured and trained. In particular, it was decided to implement a learning algorithm, in the Matlab software, and make it interact with a virtual three-dimensional reproduction of the Ball on Plate, created in the CoppeliaSim simulator. Finally, the DDPG algorithm was chosen, some simulations were performed and the data obtained were analyzed. The purpose of the algorithm was to learn to carry a sphere, regardless of its initial position on a square plate in the center of the square plate.
